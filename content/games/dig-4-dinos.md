# Dig4Dinos - Archaeological Excavation Mobile Game 🦴

Dig4Dinos is a relaxing yet deep excavation game where you become a real paleontologist. Uncover complete dinosaur skeletons by carefully digging through geological layers using professional tools.

## Game Features

• **Authentic multi-layer digging**: each layer looks and feels different  
• **Progressive tool system**: start with a brush and work your way up to heavy drills  
• **Tools are depth-limited** – choose the right one for the job  
• **Bones appear naturally at correct depths**: tiny fragments near the surface, massive skulls and ribs buried deep  
• **Gradual bone reveal**: watch fossils slowly emerge as you clear away dirt and rock

## Geological Layers & Tools

• **Brush (0–15% depth)**: Grass and topsoil – perfect for delicate bone fragments  
• **Shovel (15–30% depth)**: Dirt, sand, and clay – uncovers small bones  
• **Pickaxe (30–35% depth)**: Compacted and soft rock – reveals medium bones  
• **Drill (35–39% depth)**: Hard rock – exposes large bones and skulls  
• **39%+ depth**: Solid bedrock – unreachable until you unlock advanced upgrades

Dig at your own pace, rebuild spectacular dinosaurs, and fill your museum with prehistoric wonders. Perfect for anyone who loves dinosaurs, archaeology, or satisfying digging gameplay!
